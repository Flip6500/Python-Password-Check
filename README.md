# Python-Password-Check
Working on my first Python script. Making a tool for security to run a password strength check.
Password Strength Check on Python

For this project I decided on making a simple yet powerful Python script to help check on the strength of a password to promote stronger password usage. This in turn helps prevent or stall the advance of brute force hackers. It will make sure that passwords are 8 characters in length using special characters, at least one or more digits and a mix of capital letters. This tool being created will prompt the user immediately if the password does not meat the criteria annotated. 

Resource
	For the Python script, I used VS Code(Visual Studio Code) in order to help create and use the code.
